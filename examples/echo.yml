# example configurations for certain scenarios which you can use as templates

# subdirectories "templates" and "files" each within "directory" subdirectory
# would usually be set to the role directory where you define "containers" and keep their files
container_source_directory: "/my/directory/where/i/store/templates/and/files"

#### Example 1
# * build container from Dockerfile
# * make sure its restarted when the image changed
# * delete all files from target machine after (container can still be stopped and restarted)
containers:
  echo:
    name: "myecho"
    hosts: ["all"]
    directory: "myecho"
    image: "cogniteev/echo"
    # version: "latest"
    pull: no
    build: yes
    create: no
    restart: yes
    purge: yes
    files:
      # <container_source_directory>/files/myecho/Dockerfile
      dockerfile: { name: "Dockerfile", mode: "0644" }
      # initialconfig: { name: "config", mode: "0644", force: false } # don't overwrite, just create when missing
    templates:
      envfile: { name: "echo.env", mode: "0644" }
    run_command: 'echo "running: $FOO"'
    pre_command: "echo 1"
    create_parameters: "-e FOO=BAR --env-file echo.env"
    post_command: "echo 1"
    test_command: "ls -la"
